# The  Yocto  OS  helps  the  application  to  communicate with the attiny88 micro-controller through the i2c communication  bus  of  the  Raspberry  Pi. 
Here the Raspberry Pi is working as the master in the i2c communication and the attiny88 micro-controllers are working  as  the  slaves.  Raspberry  Pi  can  send  some data to write on the output port of the micro-controller.
